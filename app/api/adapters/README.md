# Adapters Module

This module is dedicated to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based classes that serve as adapters for various external services.

Each service should have its own dedicated file within this module. For instance:
- For the 'Payvalida' service, you should have a 'payvalida.py' file.

Each file should contain a class (or classes) responsible for interacting with the respective external service. These classes should handle operations like:
- Making API calls
- Transforming data to/from the external service's format
- Handling exceptions or errors from the external
